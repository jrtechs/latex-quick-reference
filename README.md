# What?

This repo contains a quick-start guide for people getting into latex.
Download or clone this repo and try to compile the basic_example.tex file.
This file goes over: figures, tables, cross-references, citations, math, and other basic things.

This repo also contains a curated list of templates that I commonly use for projects in the "templates" folder.

# How?

I reccomend using LaTeX using one of the three following options:

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- [VSCode Plugin: LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
- [TEXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)


# Why?

LaTeX is a powerful, fun and robust way of generating formatted documents.
Even if you are an expert at LaTeX, you are often working on templates or looking up pluggins to do new things like create DFA diagrams.
This repository serves as a quick reference for me to both access templates/examples that I frequently use, along with share what I know with others.
